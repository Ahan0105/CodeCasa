PROGRAM 1:-
Hotel Management System in C++ is a program designed to facilitate the efficient management of various hotel operations. It typically includes features such as reservation handling, room assignment, billing, and reporting. The key components and functionalities:

1)Class Design:
Create classes to represent entities like Hotel, Room, Guest, and Reservation.
Use member functions to perform operations related to each class, such as booking a room, generating a bill, and displaying guest information.

2)Reservation System:
Implement a reservation system to allow guests to book rooms. This involves checking room availability, assigning rooms, and storing reservation details.
Use data structures like arrays or linked lists to manage reservations.

3)Room Management:
Keep track of room availability, occupancy status, and room types (single, double, suite).
Implement functions to assign and free up rooms based on guest check-in and check-out.

4)Billing System:
Develop a billing system to calculate charges based on room rates, additional services (e.g., room service), and duration of stay.
Include features for handling discounts, taxes, and generating invoices.

5)Guest Information:
Store guest information, including personal details and contact information.
Implement functions to display guest details and history.

6)User Interface:
Create a user-friendly interface for the hotel staff to interact with the system.
Use console-based menus or a graphical user interface (GUI) depending on your preferences and expertise.

7)Reporting:
Include reporting features to generate summaries of room occupancy, revenue, and other relevant statistics.
Implement functions to display reports for management analysis.

8)Error Handling:
Implement robust error handling to manage situations like invalid inputs, room availability checks, and payment issues.

9)File Handling:
Use file handling mechanisms to store and retrieve data persistently. This can involve reading and writing data to files to ensure that information is preserved between program runs.

10)Security:
Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized staff can access and modify sensitive information.


PROGRAM 2:-
Student Management System in C++ implements a basic student management system with two classes: Student and Teacher. The program allows interaction from both students and teachers. a brief description of the main components and functionalities:

1)Student Class:
The Student class represents an individual student and includes attributes such as name, roll number, total score, and arrays to store pending assignment names and scores.
Students can change their personal information, view pending assignments, submit assignments (which is treated similarly to taking examinations), view their grades, and perform other tasks.

2)Teacher Class:
The Teacher class has a Teacher ID and an array of students. It provides functionalities for teachers, including assigning tasks (assignments), grading tasks, adding or editing student information, and viewing overall class statistics.

3)Main Function:
In the main function, an array of Student objects is created to store student information.
The program presents a menu-driven interface for both student and teacher logins.
Students can perform tasks such as changing personal information, submitting assignments, taking examinations, and viewing grades.
Teachers can assign tasks, grade assignments, add or edit student information, and view overall class statistics.

4)User Interface:
The code uses a simple menu-driven interface for both students and teachers.
Input is taken from the user to perform various actions, and the program responds accordingly.
The program includes error handling for invalid inputs.


PROGRAM 3:-
Login and registartion C++ code implements a simple login and registration system. a brief description of its main components and functionalities:

1)Main Function:
The program begins with a welcome message and prompts the user to either register as a new user or log in if they already have an account.
If the user is a new registrant, the program collects information such as first name, last name, email, and password. The input data is validated to meet certain criteria, and upon successful registration, a verification code is generated and sent to the user's email.
If the user is not a new registrant, they can log in by providing a username and password.

2)Registration:
The NewRegister function handles the registration process. It validates input data for first name, last name, email, and password according to specified criteria.
Validations include checking if the first and last names start with uppercase letters, verifying the email format, and ensuring the password contains at least one digit, one special character, one uppercase letter, and one lowercase letter.

3)Login:
The Login function prompts the user to enter their username and password to log in.
It includes getline to handle cases where the username might contain spaces.

4)Validation Functions:
validfirstname, validlastname, validEmail, and validpassword are helper functions to validate specific aspects of the user's input data, such as the format of the first and last names, email, and password.

5)Verification Code:
The verificationcode function simulates a verification code sent to the user's email. It generates a random code and asks the user to input the code for verification.
