A Hotel Management System in C++ is a program designed to facilitate the efficient management of various hotel operations. It typically includes features such as reservation handling, room assignment, billing, and reporting. The key components and functionalities:

1)Class Design:
Create classes to represent entities like Hotel, Room, Guest, and Reservation.
Use member functions to perform operations related to each class, such as booking a room, generating a bill, and displaying guest information.

2)Reservation System:
Implement a reservation system to allow guests to book rooms. This involves checking room availability, assigning rooms, and storing reservation details.
Use data structures like arrays or linked lists to manage reservations.

3)Room Management:
Keep track of room availability, occupancy status, and room types (single, double, suite).
Implement functions to assign and free up rooms based on guest check-in and check-out.

4)Billing System:
Develop a billing system to calculate charges based on room rates, additional services (e.g., room service), and duration of stay.
Include features for handling discounts, taxes, and generating invoices.

5)Guest Information:
Store guest information, including personal details and contact information.
Implement functions to display guest details and history.

6)User Interface:
Create a user-friendly interface for the hotel staff to interact with the system.
Use console-based menus or a graphical user interface (GUI) depending on your preferences and expertise.

7)Reporting:
Include reporting features to generate summaries of room occupancy, revenue, and other relevant statistics.
Implement functions to display reports for management analysis.

8)Error Handling:
Implement robust error handling to manage situations like invalid inputs, room availability checks, and payment issues.

9)File Handling:
Use file handling mechanisms to store and retrieve data persistently. This can involve reading and writing data to files to ensure that information is preserved between program runs.

10)Security:
Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized staff can access and modify sensitive information.
